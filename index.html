                    <article>
                        <h4>About Me</h4>
                        <p> I am the first person in my family to graduate high school and go to college. I am fully
                            bilingual
                            in Spanish and English in both written and verbal form. I believe that hard work, a positive
                            attitude, and relentless optimism are the keys to success in life. I love learning new
                            things
                            especially in technology. My goal is to work in the technology field as a Software Engineer.

                        <h4>Education </h4>
                        <p> Graduated from Centennial High School, completed all four years. Also, attended Georgia
                            State University which I completed two years. I am currently now attending General Assembly
                            booth camp in Atlanta, Georgia.

                        <h4>Culture </h4>
                        <p> I come from a hispanic background, I come from mexican parents who immigrated to the United
                            States in 1999. Mexican culture is a hugely diverse domain that encompasses vast differences
                            in identity. The variety of influences throughout Mexican history, from the ancient Mayan
                            and Aztec civilizations to the domineering European presence, has come to shape and define
                            the enthralling country it is today.
